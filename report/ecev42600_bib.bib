	abstract = {Spatially-explicit population models allow a link between demography and the landscape. We developed a spatially-explicit simulation model for the red-cockaded woodpecker, Picoidesborealis,an endangered and territorial cooperative breeder endemic to the southeastern United States. This kind of model is especially appropriate for this species because it can incorporate the spatial constraints on dispersal of helpers, and because territory locations are predictable. The model combines demographic data from a long-term study with a description of the spatial location of territories. Sensitivity analysis of demographic parameters revealed that population stability was most sensitive to changes in female breeder mortality, mortality of female dispersers and the number of fledglings produced per brood. Population behavior was insensitive to initial stage distribution; reducing the initial number of birds by one-half had a negligible effect. Most importantly, we found that the spatial distribution of territories had as strong an effect on response to demographic stoehasticity as territory number. Populations were stable when territories were highly aggregated, with as few as 49 territories. When territories were highly dispersed, more than 169 territories were required to achieve stability. Model results indicate the importance of considering the spatial distribution of territories in management plans, and suggest that this approach is worthy of further development. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.
